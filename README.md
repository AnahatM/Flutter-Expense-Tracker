## 📱About the app

It includes complete create, read, update, and delete functionality for all logged expenses, and cleanly displays the expenses data in an easy-to-read bar weekly overview at the top with a bar graph. The app also saves user data locally on the device using Hive, a lightweight key-value database for Flutter.
