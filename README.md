# Minimalist Expense Tracker

This is a simple, minimalist cross-platform expense-tracker mobile app made with Flutter and programmed in Dart.

## 💵 About the app

It includes complete create, read, update, and delete functionality for all logged expenses, and cleanly displays the expenses data in an easy-to-read bar weekly overview at the top with a bar graph. The app also saves user data locally on the device using Hive, a lightweight key-value database for Flutter.
